Patterns Examples
=================

Provide working examples using Swift Playgrounds for each of the pattern protocols from the [Patterns Project](https://github.com/davidbjames/Patterns). Each example is broken down into simple or complex implementations, including documentation.

> The Examples project was originally developed so I could "prove" each pattern in a practical and workable context. Many of the decisions for how a pattern should be represented were shaped by how useful the pattern was in concrete running examples. Ultimately, the best "example" is real life, and I hope that will better define the patterns, since some of these examples are contrived.
